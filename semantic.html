            <p> There are many variations of sports, but all with the same purpose! Sports can help you stay healthy not only physically but also mentally while having a good time! </p>
        
            <p> Sports can be played or watched. Sometimes athletes are so good at playing a sport, that they are paid millions of dollars each years. Normally people watch these athletes play their sport from home or at the site of the game/match/meet. Those who just play for fun have a number of sports to choose from all that require different landscapes, amount of people and equipment. </p>
        
            <p> There are some sports that I love to watch but could never play and some I love to play but hate to watch. For example I love watching ice hockey games, but there is no way I could ever play hockey. Another example is that I love to play golf but I find it so boring to watch</p>
